    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and debuggable solution for the BookSnap application, adhering to the principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters).\n\n**Authorization Independence:**  Authorization independence is achieved by storing the `userId` within the LibraryEntry and Recommendation documents. This denormalization eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules to verify the user's ownership, enabling atomic operations (transactions/batches) and simplifies debugging.\n\n**Structural Segregation (Homogeneous Security Posture):** The structure segregates user-specific data into subcollections under the `/users/{userId}` path, ensuring that all documents within those subcollections share the same security requirements, in particular, ownership by the specified user.\n\n**Access Modeling (Standardization and Consistency):** Access control is modeled using path-based ownership. Each user has their own LibraryEntries and Recommendations stored under their respective user ID, enforcing private data access based on the authenticated user ID.\n\n**QAPs Support:** The structure supports secure `list` operations by using path-based ownership. Rules can easily filter based on the `userId` to allow listing only the LibraryEntries and Recommendations associated with the authenticated user.\n\n**Invariants:** The structure supports the integrity of ownership by explicitly storing the `userId` in each LibraryEntry and Recommendation, ensuring that the correct user is always associated with their data."
